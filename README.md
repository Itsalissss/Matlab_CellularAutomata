# Matlab_CellularAutomata

Project developed at Utrecht University during the Energy Science master thesis course in Environmental System Analysis. 
It has been developed on MatLab and regards the calculation of fire propagation within a forest with different types of vegetation, also considering probability of fire depending on different factors and using them to estimate how this fire propagation would happen through many years and how this will transform the vegetation. Some factors taken into account are vegetation growth and death.
